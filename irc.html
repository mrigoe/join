<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>
  Some people don't know how to behave in <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>,
  so here are some simple rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't ask if you can ask questions, just ask.</li>
  <li>Be patient when you ask something, people might not be around.</li>
  <li>Don't spam.</li>
  <li>Don't flood the channel with messages or bot commands.</li>
  <li>Use a pastebin if you want to post more than 4 lines (such as error messages or code).</li>
  <li>Annoying, racist, or any form of derogatory terms against any user or channel operator will probably get you quieted; or even banned.</li>
  <li>If you're going to ask someone something, "please" goes a very long way.</li>
  <li>The channels are not playgrounds and are frequently used for talks which are not off-topic.</li>
  <li>Off-topic is allowed, but excessive use of it is disallowed.</li>
  <li>Link shorteners are discouraged for URLs that are not very long.</li>
</ul>
